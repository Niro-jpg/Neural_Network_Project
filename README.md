# Neural_Network_Project
## Introduction
The aim of the project is to create an SRNN algorithm based on...

# Architecture
* **Net:** We developed..
* 
# Data
## Dataset
Our Dataset

# Libraries
* Pythorch
* Scikit Learn
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Torchtext
# Usage

Before to start install all the libraries listed before.

To start the program you have to be in the one of the 2 folders in the project, tiping `cd ./Classification` or `cd ./Regression`.
In the folder simply type `python main.py` or `python main.py`. 

## Arguments
The main functions take various arguments. To use test the training of one neural network `-t`, to reload a saved neural network `-r` and to train all the neural networks to plot our experiments `-i`.

### Test Aguments
If type `-t` you can use more arguments:

* `-m` for the model you want to train, followed by the initial letter of the possible models: `rlsg`
* `-s` to save the model
* `-l` to select the learning rate
* `-p` to plot the loss
* `-e` to select the number of epochs
* `-b` to select the batch size
* `-d` to choose the directory of the dataset
* `-h` to select the hidden size
